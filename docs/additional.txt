The AI model is hosted on an AWS EC2 Virtual Server, and it's main function is to get an input of a human selfie, 
and return back a 3D obj file of the user (which is basically a 3d model of the human face). 
Hence, you first need to store the user uploaded selfie image onto the s3 bucket, and get a link of that uploaded image. 
Then, you pass this link to the AI model to process that image, then the model will also return a link of the output 3d obj file.

This is how you use the API:
1) start the server
2) check the status of the server (make sure it is started)
3) manual loading (delay) for 3 minutes: server need to warm up before ready to use
4) upload image
5) dry run process image API for three times
6) fourth time of running process image API will only 100% give u back the output (a bug that cant be solve, so getting the 4th times result will be perfect)
7) stop server
8) check the status of the server (make sure it is stopped as it is super expensive)

Note: start, stop and check server required the authorization token as the header
Note: please do double confirm that you stop the server when you are not doing the development, and also do use it wisely and don't consume too much resources.
Note: to prevent unexpected behaviour or bad actor, running server shall be stopped after running for 3 minutes, or when window tab is closed. 
This will ensure that the server will not keep running all the time if the whole process didnt reach the Step7 (stop server API calling)
