## What is Digital Human Project?

**Digital Human Project is the first proof of personhood on Aptos**. The goal is to build a human-only digital identity network (human-centric) that allows individuals to easily claim their humanness in this AI era surrounded by bots. The core concept is to store human identity data on Aptos as digital assets, which is called the Digital Human ID, that humans can carry across the different ecosystem applications and prove themselves as unique humans for simple verification, acting as a universal digital identification. Humans are able to mint biometric tokens with their biometric data and compose them to form a complex Digital Human ID with higher verification levels. Digital Human ID can be easily intergated to DApps as sign-in method or gate content based on the verification level. The biometric tokens concept also open up endless possibilities of biometric data or even personal info (for example: DNA profiles, voice data, signatures, school ID) which can be used to mint a verification token and increase an individual verification level of their Digital Human ID. Soon, the project is ready to introduce custom biometric hardwares and set up physical verification points worldwide to ensure a more trusted environment during the verification process.

## üí™ Tackling Problems of Digital Identity Space

1.  **Proving Humanness Is Hard**: AI has made proving humanness more challenging, especially during Sybil attacks, where bots surround real humans. How can we easily identify ourselves as humans and be able to gate some content or space for only humans and not bots? We need a medium that embed all our identity information, and can easily prove our humanness for fast verification in different applications and real-world use case.
   
2.  **Lack of Privacy and Ownership**: Although there are various identity solutions (for example: email and phone verification, hybrid method verification, official KYC - Know Your Customer, Web of Trust, etc), privacy is a fundamental human right, and our sensitive personal data or biometrics should not be handled by centralised third parties. In other word, we should have full ownership of our digital identity data which is handled in a decentralised way. Hence, an open and permissionless protocol is needed.

3.  **Not All-In-One**: There is no existing solution which pack all your digital identity data (personal data or biometrics) into one and let you to carry around the ecosystem for utilisation.

4.  **Sensitive Data Security Consideration**: Existing digital identity solution is not safe from some security aspects as applications or third-party will have direct access to it. We need a session-specific ID mechanism which can perform ephemeral verification using our digital identity, but without direct access.

## ‚≠ê The Solutions

1. **Digital Human ID Concept**: Introducing the concept of Digital Human ID, which stores human identity data on Aptos as digital assets (DAs) that individuals can carry across the ecosystem, enabling them to verify their uniqueness simply. Individuals just have to connect their wallet containing the Digital Human ID to the application, and the application will fetch the related information from the ID for further verification purposes.

2. **Encrypted Identity Data**: The digital identity data embedded in the Digital Human ID is encrypted using a military-grade encryption system, ensuring that sensitive digital identity data will not be exposed in the public blockchain environment. Individuals have full ownership and control, being the only ones to grant permission when applications request access.

3. **DeepFace AI Engine**: Our team's self-developed AI engine, is designed with a focus on inclusivity and simplicity. It can onboard humans at a large scale and create their digital human IDs with minimal device requirements, in less time, and regardless of geographic location. Just upload a selfie, and our AI engine uses deep learning to create a complete facial graph and reconstruct a 3D digital duplicate of the person. All this data will then be used to mint a digital human ID.

4. **Multi-layer Verification Mechanism**: The Digital Human Project utilizes a multi-layer verification mechanism, allowing individuals to further verify their identities and increase their verification level. Introducing an innovative idea called biometric tokens, iris scans, fingerprints, and detailed facial data can all be stored as digital assets (DAs) on the Aptos blockchain. These components are combined to form a more complex and comprehensive Digital Human ID, demonstrating another creative and feasible use case of the composability of NFTs on Aptos in the digital identity space.

5. **Universal Digital Identification**: Digital Human ID will become a universal digital identification used for sign-in methods, easily earning verification status on applications. Moreover, it can gate content based on your verification level. In the future, more types of verification tokens may be introduced to accommodate real-world use cases.

6. **Possibility for ZK-Based Ephemeral Verification**: Digital Human ID integration can also be extended to be used in ZK-based ephemeral verification in the future, which is session-specific. Each time a user logs into an application and wants to verify themselves, a unique ZK proof of the digital identity data of the user will be generated, and the application will verify this proof. No direct access to data will be needed anymore!
   
7. **Custom Hardwares:HUMAN and Physical Verification Points**: The demo shown is a prototype and not ideal for verifying biometric data in untrusted environments. Therefore, our upcoming plan is to introduce custom hardware solutions and establishing physical verification points worldwide. This ensures authenticity, as you must attend in person for verification. Our hardware will then generate a unique code for your scanned biometric data, creating a biometric token for verification and bind it to your Digital Human ID. This process is similar to how you create and mint your biometrics verification tokens via our prototype.
